The lakehouse is an architecture designed to replace both data warehouses and data lakes by creating tables through transactional metadata layers on top of storage files. This study evaluates common table formats such as Apache Hudi, Apache Iceberg, and Delta Lake for their approaches to metadata management, use of storage files, and performance optimizations. Load tests with inserts, deletes, and updates reveal problematic patterns and design choices for each table format. The effectiveness of potential mitigation measures such as caching and compaction is assessed.
